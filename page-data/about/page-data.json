Austin State University provides numerous opportunities for performance in both the concert hall and athletic arena, as well as fostering the growth of its instrumental music majors. Four concert bands are available over the course of an academic year. The four concert bands include the Wind Ensemble, Wind Symphony, Symphonic Band, and University Band. Each group provides performing opportunities for university students of varied playing abilities, majors and interests. A total of almost twenty performances a year by the SFA concert bands is held in Turner Auditorium and Cole Concert Hall.</p>\n<p>Outside of the concert hall, the band program at SFA takes pride in the visibility of its athletic bands, seen throughout Texas and the rest of the country. In its 95th year of supporting Lumberjack football, the 300- member Lumberjack Marching Band performs for thousands of fans and alumni each year while striving for excellence in both the corps and military-style marching genres. The “Roarin’ Buzzsaws” Men’s and Women’s Basketball Bands perform at nearly every home basketball game for the Lumberjack and Ladyjack basketball teams, supporting the teams throughout their yearly quest towards the NCAA Basketball tournament. In the School of Music, two jazz bands and numerous chamber groups associated with the studios of the applied faculty are found, comprised almost entirely of students who are part of the ever-growing SFA Band Program. Many of the band students enhance their musical experience at SFA by performing in orchestra as well.</p>\n<p>For over sixty years, the annual SFA Summer Band Camps have drawn thousands of middle school and high school students from across the state of Texas to Nacogdoches for a week of character building, music-making and collaboration with a staff made up of Texas music educators and university faculty. Finally, the SFA Band program strives to build outstanding musicians who are as proficient in the classroom as they are on the concert stage, and, with a 100% placement rate for teaching positions in the state of Texas, SFA continues to provide the children of Texas with high quality music teachers.</p>\n<h1>Directors of the SFA Bands, 1926–Present</h1>\n<h2>Director of Bands</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>David W.
