Since this decision has been made, it has become obvious that we will need to alter how we manage admission for The Lumberjack Marching Band. So, we have decided to not hold auditions for the 2020 fall season. You are welcome to submit an audition video for scholarship consideration, but everyone will be accepted into the band for this fall. If you would like to submit a video, please either share a video with me through Google Drive or an unlisted/private YouTube video. If you are an incoming music major, you do not need to submit a video at all.</p>\n<p>Here are the next steps you need to complete to become a member of LMB:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Join <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1338894039639414/\">“The 2020 Lumberjack Marching Band”</a> Facebook page. We use that page as our main form of communication with the band throughout the year, but especially in the summer.</li>\n<li>Once SFA has determined how they are going to do their freshman orientation, make sure you enroll in MUEN 1236 section 001 (woodwinds/brass), MUEN 1236 section 002 (colorguard/twirlers), MUEN 1236 section 003 (drumline), or MUEN 1236 section 004 (front ensemble). Once you’re enrolled, then we can add you to our list for band camp dorms.</li>\n<li>Dorm move-in will be Sunday, August 16 from 3-5 pm for woodwinds/brass and you will be able to move in to your actual assigned dorm for the semester. (Colorguard and drumline auditions will be August 12-15—you will get more information later on your dorm move-in)</li>\n<li>Band camp for EVERYBODY is from August 16-22. We provide lunch and dinner every day, but not breakfast. Make sure you bring granola bars, cereal bars, etc. for breakfast every day.</li>\n<li>We will share a link on the Facebook page at a later date to purchase all of the LMB gear you will need for the season through Spirit Outfitters: LMB t-shirt, polo, hat, and wind suit.</li>\n<li>Things you will need to bring with you for LMB uniforms: black marching shoes (matte black, not shiny), black slacks, black belt, tall black socks, lyre, and flip folder.</li>\n<li>I have recently announced that we are postponing our trip to Rome, Italy to perform in the 2021 New Year’s Day Parade to the next year. This will give you more time to save up for the trip! You can also join our LMB to Rome! Facebook page to get more information about the trip.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please let me know if you have any questions and, once leadership/section leaders are chosen, you will be hearing from one of them. We are looking forward to having you in the LMB next year—it’s the best decision you could make and you will never regret it!</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Tamey Anglley</em><br>\n<em>Associate Director of Bands</em><br>\n<em>Director, The Lumberjack Marching Band</em><br></p>\n<p><em>Stephen F.
